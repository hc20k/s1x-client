## Compile from source

- Clone the Git repo. Do NOT download it as ZIP, that won't work.
- Update the submodules and run `premake5 vs2019` or simply use the delivered `generate.bat`.
- Build via solution file in `build\s1-mod.sln`.

### Premake arguments

| `--copy-to=PATH`            | Optional, copy the EXE to a custom folder after build, define the path here if wanted. |
| `--dev-build`               | Enable development builds of the client. |
